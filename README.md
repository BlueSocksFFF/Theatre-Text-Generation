# Theatre-Text-Generation

## General Languages and Packages Required
Python == 3.10+


## Language Model

We are invoking the GPT3 "text-davinci-003" model for generation of monologues.

#### Files

Main.py

    For testing purposes, main.py begins with a write_to_api call so that we may set a prompt for our language model to use. We are assuming it will normally receive an engineered prompt.

    A prompt is pulled down from an "avatar_prompts" file.

    That prompt is fed into our gpt3 model and a monologue is given back

    We send that monologue to the API through write_to_api and the file name "avatar_texts"



api_client.py  

    write_to_api(content, file)
    Writes to the Avatar API. Write will rewrite the file, not append to it. Write will create a file if one does not exist.
    
    append_to_api(content, file)
       

    read_from_api(file)
        

    read_latest_from_api(file)


prompts.json
- holds the format of a prompt

gpt3_generated_text
- holds the text generated by gpt3 language model
