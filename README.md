# Theatre-Text-Generation

## General Languages and Packages Required
Python == 3.10+


## Language Model

We are invoking the GPT3 "text-davinci-003" model for generation of monologues.

#### Files

Main.py

    For testing purposes, main.py begins with a write_to_api call so that we may set a prompt for our language model to use. We are assuming it will normally receive an engineered prompt.

    A prompt is pulled down from an "avatar_prompts" file.

    That prompt is fed into our gpt3 model and a monologue is given back

    We send that monologue to the API through write_to_api and the file name "avatar_texts"



api_client.py  

    write_to_api(content, file)
    Writes to the Avatar API. Write will rewrite the file, not append to it. Write will create a file if one does not exist.
    
    append_to_api(content, file)
       

    read_from_api(file)
        

    read_latest_from_api(file)


prompts.json
- holds the format of a prompt

gpt3_generated_text
- holds the text generated by gpt3 language model


#### Installation
We recommend that you download the packages in a virtual environment.
In Windows:
```
py -m venv env
```
To activate: 
```
env\Scripts\activate
```
After you have your virtual environment set up, run the command below to install all of the packages relevant to this project.

```
pip install -r requirements.txt

```
If the above command does not work, refer to requirements.txt and download the individual packages.

#### Environment Variables
To run our generator, you would need to obtain your own API keys. Please refer to the .env.example file, which is a template for your .env file, and create your own .env file and put down your API keys there. Make sure to keep them to yourself, hence we did not include any API keys in this repo.
