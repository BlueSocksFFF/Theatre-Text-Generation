Artist is a word I struggle with. I always wanted to be an artist, but I still don't know what that means. For me, it means being able to create anything I want. But what does that even mean? How do you create anything? Do you start with a vision, or does the idea come to you later? Do you need an education, or can you learn as you go? 
  
I think maybe I'm an artist, but I'm also a realist. In my life, I've seen too much pain, and too much suffering. I wouldn't want my creativity to cause anyone else pain. So the question is, how do you create and be artistic, without causing pain?
