AI21 from artist:   
Artist is a word I struggle with. I always wanted to be an artist, but I still don't know what that means. For me, it means being able to create anything I want. But what does that even mean? How do you create anything? Do you start with a vision, or does the idea come to you later? Do you need an education, or can you learn as you go? 
  
I think maybe I'm an artist, but I'm also a realist. In my life, I've seen too much pain, and too much suffering. I wouldn't want my creativity to cause anyone else pain. So the question is, how do you create and be artistic, without causing pain? 
AI21 from tomato:  My girlfriend dumped me because I never cooked her dinner. What kind of a guy does that? I always used to cook her dinner, but sheâ€™d get mad at me if the tomatoes were too big or the pizza was too thin. I thought it was because she cared about me, but now I know she only cared about my cooking.

I love sunshine. It makes me happy. I spend a lot of time outside, and sunshine is a great way to recharge my batteries. I like feeling warm sunshine on my face, and I like feeling warmth from the sun on my back. I like feeling warm sunshine on my arms, and I like feeling warm sunshine on my legs. I like feeling warm sunshine on my hands, and I like feeling warm sunshine on my toes.

We've been to the doctor, but we can't figure out what's wrong. We spent a lot of money on tests, and it's getting expensive. We don't know what to do, and it's getting on our nerves. 
  
We've been to a therapist, but we can't get any answers there,
