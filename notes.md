Current Work:

FIRST MONOLOGUE 
    should take in a suggestion, or multiple suggestions, and return a monologue that
    is rich enough for improvisers to work off of. 

        We will generate 2 simultaneously as a precaution for API disconnect/failure
            - GPT3 monologue generator
            - GPT3.5 monologue generator



Prompt should direct this monologue to be off the cuff, without precise language, essentially imitating an improviser who is coming up with a monologue on the spot. We want a solid emotional arc to the text, drawing from emotion words we have already gathered. 


SECOND MONOLOGUE 
    should take in the themes/key phrases from the FIRST monologue, as well as themes/key phrases from the following improv scenes. It should incorporate that information into the text and try to bring a sense of closure to the piece. 


________________
System itself will be asking questions to a dreamer 
How do we stop it going along one path that we dont want it to go down
Need the AI to go back to our base questions
Want the AI to be driving the conversation 
Answers then become a set of prompts
- Person is an accountant
- Person had this for breakfast
- Has kids
- Is married

Some dreams are nightmares, some dreams are pleasant

Need control of the questions

Managing questions you have asked


Write down 5 questions you would ask 
Explain to system how you want these questions asked, how the conversation is going to go

do we need to worry about identifying the suggestions as relationship, occupation, etc. 

Gut says no because we will be passed JSON with that info 

Sentiment Manipulation for second monologue where we get the overwhelming sentiment from the preceding monologue + scenes and then insert that into the second monologue's prompt


parallel processing -- 
    multi processing versus threaded processing

    multi process preferred way of parallel programming

Notes from rehearsal 3/19/23

- the ai voice being so jarring when it begins to talk-- way to better indicate it is about to speak, or it is finished speaking (light in background) so that we aren't just dependent on its cadence/watching its lips 

- so easy to laugh at her, kinda takes away her power when that happens

having the AI be involved enough that it's impressive
- not just calling switch for sit, lean, stand

- Interviewing an audience member with the help of a player 
    - deciding based on the content of that interview wether it will be a dream or a nightmare
    - accompanied by a sinister sound/light cue

    - if we want interjections, lead in with a twinkling sound effect, sinister sound effect
        - interject a setting, a character, describe something that the improvisers can then inhabit

- giving a wrap up or epilogue at the end, that was the dream/nightmare -- here is how it affected their life afterwards or this is how they can grow from that

Anna's nightmare


second_base_prompt = "write a nightmare about a girl named Anna. She works at a real estate law firm. Her boss is great, he is good at putting things into realistic, tangible terms. She only works with two people. She usually makes coffee on her machine, an iced latte. Then she'll listen to some music, like Faye Webster, who is an emotional sad girl. She then goes to the gym. There is a guy at the gym she thinks is obsessed with her but she saw him at the coffee shop and that freaked her out: he shouldn't be there. She is reading a book called midnight library that is based on multiverses"


Anna woke up in a cold sweat, her heart racing. She had just had the most terrifying nightmare. In the dream, she was at work in the real estate law firm where she usually worked. Her boss was there, but he wasn't the same kind man that she was used to. Instead, he was cruel and demanding, constantly shouting at her and belittling her work.

As Anna tried to escape from her boss's wrath, she found herself trapped in a dark hallway. The walls were closing in on her, and she could feel herself getting smaller and smaller by the second. She screamed for help, but no one came.

Suddenly, Anna found herself back in the office with her boss. But this time, he had transformed into a monstrous creature with razor-sharp teeth and glowing red eyes. He lunged at Anna, ready to devour her whole.

In a panic, Anna fled the office and ran out onto the street. But as she looked around, she realized that nothing was familiar anymore. The buildings were twisted and distorted beyond recognition, and people were wandering around like mindless zombies.

Anna felt like she was trapped in some kind of nightmare world that she couldn't escape from. She desperately tried to wake up from the dream but couldn't seem to shake it off.

As she stumbled down the street in terror, Anna suddenly saw the man from the gym following her again. But this time he wasn't just watching her; he was chasing after her with a knife.

Anna ran for what felt like hours until finally waking up in a cold sweat. She sat up panting heavily trying to shake off the dream before realizing it was just that - a dream - albeit one that shook her to core due to its vividness and intensity.
