Current Work:

FIRST MONOLOGUE 
    should take in a suggestion, or multiple suggestions, and return a monologue that
    is rich enough for improvisers to work off of. 

        We will generate 2 simultaneously as a precaution for API disconnect/failure
            - GPT3 monologue generator
            - GPT3.5 monologue generator



Prompt should direct this monologue to be off the cuff, without precise language, essentially imitating an improviser who is coming up with a monologue on the spot. We want a solid emotional arc to the text, drawing from emotion words we have already gathered. 


SECOND MONOLOGUE 
    should take in the themes/key phrases from the FIRST monologue, as well as themes/key phrases from the following improv scenes. It should incorporate that information into the text and try to bring a sense of closure to the piece.

System itself will be asking questions to a dreamer 
How do we stop it going along one path that we dont want it to go down
Need the AI to go back to our base questions
Want the AI to be driving the conversation 
Answers then become a set of prompts
- Person is an accountant
- Person had this for breakfast
- Has kids
- Is married

Some dreams are nightmares, some dreams are pleasant

Need control of the questions

Managing questions you have asked


Write down 5 questions you would ask 
Explain to system how you want these questions asked, how the conversation is going to go
